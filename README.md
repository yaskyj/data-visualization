## Summary
This visualization shows the average years in school by country against the national GDP per person in USD adjusted for inflation. These features are shown by year and the bubble points on the chart are sized by the population. The chart shows that GDP in positively correlated with the level of education of the country and that both of these measures generally increase from year to year. It also shows that there is not a strong correlation in all cases, such as with Eastern Europe and Russia (i.e. former Soviet bloc countries).
## Design

## Feedback

Going to quick, can't view the individual dots - Not going quick enough - added slider
Axis labels too small
title too small, not enough information
no explanation of the bubble size
No explanation of the axis
legend spaced weirdly
Bottom of the chart is cluttered looking with so many bubbles
GDP not explained as USD and adjusted for inflation
Too many years cluttering the side
